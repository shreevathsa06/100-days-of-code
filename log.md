# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**:  
- Started building a **Password Generator project** to brush up my JavaScript skills through project-based learning.  
- Learned and practiced:  
  - `Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`  
  - Loops (`for`)  
  - Strings & arrays (storing and picking characters)  
  - Functions with parameters  
  - Conditionals (`if` checks for user choices)  
- read some javascript docs on MDN about widely used array and string methods.
- Built:  
  - Character sets (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)  
  - A helper function `getRandomChar(set)` to pick a random character  
  - A basic password generator that can create an 8-character password  
  - Extended version with parameters: password length + user-selected sets (merged into a pool).  
- Parallelly learned about **JavaScript’s asynchronous nature** — Web APIs, callback stack, microtask queue, and event loop (through a YouTube video).

### Day 2: September 10, Wednesday  

**Today's Progress**:  
- Focused on **DOM manipulation and UI integration** in the Password Generator project.  
- Reviewed:  
  - DOM selectors (`querySelector`, `getElementById`)  
  - Event listeners (`addEventListener("click", fn)`)  
- Built:  
  - An HTML form with input for password length, checkboxes for options, and a generate button  
  - Displayed the generated password in a text field  
  - Connected the JavaScript logic to DOM events
    
- Solved one DSA problem: **Maximum value at a given index in a bounded array**  

**Thoughts**:  
Integrating JS with the DOM made the project more interactive and real. It feels rewarding to see my code directly affecting the UI. Solving the DSA problem was a good brain exercise alongside project work.

### Day 3: September 11, Thursday  

**Today's Progress**:  
- Learned about the **Clipboard API** in JavaScript and implemented it in the Password Manager project.  
- Added **error handling** to the project.  
- Finished and polished the **Password Manager UI** with the help of Gemini.  
- Solved **2 DSA questions**.  
- https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/

**Thoughts**:  
Today felt like a milestone — integrating the Clipboard API and adding error handling made the project more user-friendly. Polishing the UI was satisfying and gave the project a complete look. Practicing DSA alongside helped keep my problem-solving sharp.

### Day 4: September 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I strengthened my CSS skills by building a pomodoro timer from scratch. The timer was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned about functions like `setInterval()`, which was key to the timer's functionality.

**Thoughts**: It was a great learning experience applying my skills to a practical project. The `setInterval()` function was a bit tricky at first, but I'm now confident in using it for timed events. I'm excited to continue applying my skills to more projects.
