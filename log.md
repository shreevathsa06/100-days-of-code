# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9, Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**:  
- Started building a **Password Generator project** to brush up my JavaScript skills through project-based learning.  
- Learned and practiced:  
  - `Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`  
  - Loops (`for`)  
  - Strings & arrays (storing and picking characters)  
  - Functions with parameters  
  - Conditionals (`if` checks for user choices)  
- read some javascript docs on MDN about widely used array and string methods.
- Built:  
  - Character sets (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)  
  - A helper function `getRandomChar(set)` to pick a random character  
  - A basic password generator that can create an 8-character password  
  - Extended version with parameters: password length + user-selected sets (merged into a pool).  
- Parallelly learned about **JavaScript’s asynchronous nature** — Web APIs, callback stack, microtask queue, and event loop (through a YouTube video).
